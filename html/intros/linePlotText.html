    At the National Level: A High-Level Comparison<br><br>

    This line plot shows the normalized data for each dataset, and you can use the slider to select the range of years you would
    like to see. Normalizing is a process where each dataset is plotted on a scale from 0 to 1, with the smallest value becoming
    0 and the largest becoming 1. It is valuable for comparing datasets like income income, crime, and education, because income
    is in the tens of thousands, and crime and education are scaled as percents of incidents or populations. You can see how generally,
    as income increases, crime decreases, and in 2004 income and education begin to follow the same trajectory.
