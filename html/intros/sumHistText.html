    This bar chart allows you to select three states that you would like to compare, the year, and one dataset. It allows you
    to take a more in depth look at what might have influenced a state during a specific point in time, rather than a trend over
    time. For example, you can use the graph to see New Mexico and Nevada, the two extremes of 2000, compared against the state of Washington.
