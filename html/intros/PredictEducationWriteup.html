    <h3>Tree</h3><br>

    On this page we use a machine learning model package called rpart to predict the future education scores in states around the US.
    We used a training data set including state data up to six years in the past regarding crime, income, and education.
    Using this information and a machine learning algorthm we can make a very rough prediction of the education level across the US.<br><br>

    <h3>Data</h3><br>

    Though the estimation is rough we can already see some interesting defining factors chosen by the algorithm. One observation is
    that the absolute value of income takes precedence over any and all trends seen in the state. Because education is largely based
    on infrastructure it is more vital that a state once had a lot of money for infrastructure than it is that the state is growing in
    income or fighting back crime.<br><br>

    The most interesting fact for me however is that the primary splits made by the tree are entirely based on current income levels
    in the state. In fact, even more interestingly the second cut is made at around the national median of income meaning that if you
    are below the median national income chances are you fall into the very lowest branches of education score regardless of other
    aspects we accounted for and if you fall into the upper levels of income you will likely receive very high quality education.
    This immediately highlights the weight that economic class has on access to education in the US. Considering that upper education
    is often listed as one of the keys to economic success this implies a viscous cycle of poverty and low quality education that defines
    the college going youth. In fact, the next tier of splits is reliant on income trends as well. The algorithm trusts money above
    crime and education to predict where education quality is going.
