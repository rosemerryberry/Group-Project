    At the State or National Level: Statistical Trends<br><br>

    This plot allows you to manipulate the data set that is being displayed, and you can choose a specific state or a national
    average to display. The superimposed line shows the statistical trend of the data. As you can see, as income increases, education
    increases and crime decreases.
