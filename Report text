TEXT FOR REPORT


A big part of this project is to not only show crime, education, and income data on their own, but to also understand the relationship between the three. This page contains elements to help you explore that relationship, on a state or national level. 

At the State Level: The Extremes

This table shows the states that have the maximum or minimum value for each data set, for each year. As you can see, there are several states that seem to dominate the minimum or maximum end of the spectrum.

At the State Level: A Comparison Tool

This bar chart allows you to select three states that you would like to compare, the year, and one dataset. It allows you to take a more in depth look at what might have influenced a state during a specific point in time, rather than a trend over time. For example, [HERE I WILL PUT AN EXAMPLE WHEN I CAN SEE THE GRAPH]

At the National Level: A High-Level Comparison

This line plot shows the normalized data for each dataset, and you can use the slider to select the range of years you would like to see. Normalizing is a process where each dataset is plotted on a scale from 0 to 1, with the smallest value becoming 0 and the largest becoming 1. It is valuable for comparing datasets like income income, crime, and education, because income is in the tens of thousands, and crime and education are scaled as percents of incidents or populations. You can see how generally, as income increases, crime decreases, and in 2004 income and education begin to follow the same trajectory.

At the State or National Level: Statistical Trends

This plot allows you to manipulate the data set that is being displayed, and you can choose a specific state or a national average to display. The superimposed line shows the statisical trend of the data. As you can see, as income increases, education increases and crime decreases.
